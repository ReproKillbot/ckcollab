We're agile..! Often times we have to conform to our clients workflow and fold ourselves
in, but below we'll describe our ideal process.

# What we do

Our input is a problems and our output is some solution. It turns out, typically getting the
input right is the hardest part!

Communicating what is wrong and what is needed is difficult. When you say the user should
be able to schedule a meeting what does that _really_ mean? Well, it probably means
only certain people should be able to see the schedule, only certain people
should be able to schedule a meeting, meetings shouldn't be longer than 3 hours,
we need a way to keep meeting minutes organized, and.. so on. 



# How we do it


To solve the clients problems effectively we need as much up front communication in the form 
of specs, wire-frames, in person meets, and video chats as possible. The more concrete
the details the better &mdash; in most cases!

On one end of the pendulum we have a client that gives us perfect specs with a complete 
overview, screenshots describing where things need to be added to each page, and even 
sometimes known problems that could happen. On the other end of the pendulum, we
have a client that says "do what you want" while sometimes being very unhappy with the
result, which is frustrating, but we understand that extremely busy clients sometimes
need the iteration on our end first.



# Sprint schedule

Sprints are in 2 week chunks with a review meeting at the end. On the last day of sprints
we demo the work done and also go over any internal problems we're having.

### Scoring tasks

To plan effectively we "score tasks" by giving them a difficulty number, then using
this "scoring" we can determine how long an entire project will take. To effectively
determine the progress and landing date of some project.

### Velocity 

We calculate our "velocity" of points done per sprint by averaging our points over the 
last 3 weeks. Given our "velocity" we can plot the landing date on a burndown chart.



## Day -1 (before the first sprint ever starts)

On a new project the bulk of tasks are scored in a "kick off meeting" 

## Day 0 (before sprint ends)

### Backlog grooming

We "groom the backlog" of tasks, which means to go over the list of problems and
the client puts in order the priority they would like us to get things done. Any
questions we have on tasks should be answered here.

Importantly, we organize our sprints with backloog grooming sessions before the beginning 
of the next sprint. This way we can start a sprint with as fresh of priority as possible.

## Day 1 - Sprint end & review, start of new sprint

We end the previous sprint and start the next one on the same day.

### Demoing

It's extremely important to have each of our engineers demo their work so we're all on the
same page on behavior and it gives us all an opportunity to glean some new library, tool,
or methodology. 

Also, for some of us it's a great chance to show off. It's important to not forget
engineers express themselves through their work, if none of your teammates get to see
the awesome shit you're working on it's a real bummer!



### Internal review

We keep track of what's causing pain and what's getting better. If someone has been 
having some stress with a client, something in their life, or anything else, we try
to talk through it and help out. 



### Planning

Before the sprint planning meeting everyone on the team already has a list of tasks
they've gone over with the project manager, and the project manager just groomed
the backlog with the client the day before so tasks are extremely fresh.

During the meeting it is rather quick as we score tasks to help plan their difficulty.


## Day 2 - 14

<div style="text-align: center;">

The project managers make sure we're staying on track to end, informing the client and
engineers as we need to add or remove features to land on time.

### Staying on track

???




### Don't add mid-sprint!

It's key to keep track of velocity in a consistent way. If we can measure each sprint produces ~100pts with our experienced
team of 4 engineers, then when we estimate a project is worth 200pts of work we can accurately expect it to be done within
2 sprints. _However,_ if we add work mid-sprint consistently, we can't predict when the work will be completed.

It sounds obvious, but if we don't know exactly what we're making up front then there's no way we can predict how long
it will take. Even when we know _exactly_ what we're making, in the middle of making it there could be some strange
conflict of libraries, deprecation of a feature we've relied on before, or _exactly_ what we're supposed to make
turns out to not feel-so-great!

For software development it's important to be able to throw away work that ends up sucking and not fall into the sunk cost
fallacy. If it feels bad, will be hard to maintain, or the users just plain don't like it.. we have to pivot.
