We use sprint stuff...!

Define: velocity, sprint, backlog grooming

# Sprint schedule

# Don't add mid-sprint!

It's key to keep track of velocity in a consistent way. If we can measure each sprint produces ~100pts with our experienced
team of 4 engineers, then when we estimate a project is worth 200pts of work we can accurately expect it to be done within
2 sprints. _However,_ if we add work mid-sprint consistently, we can't predict when the work will be completed.

It sounds obvious, but if we don't know exactly what we're making up front then there's no way we can predict how long
it will take. Even when we know _exactly_ what we're making, in the middle of making it there could be some strange
conflict of libraries, deprecation of a feature we've relied on before, or _exactly_ what we're supposed to make
turns out to not feel-so-great!

For software development it's important to be able to throw away work that ends up sucking and not fall into the sunk cost
fallacy. If it feels bad, will be hard to maintain, or the users just plain don't like it.. we have to pivot.
